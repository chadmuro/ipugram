# IpuGram :camera:

Instead of creating an InstaGram account for my dog, I decided to build him his own app. IpuGram is a photo gallery web app highlighting memories of my French Bulldog. I created this app with React Hooks and Context API. The styling is done with Material-UI and the backend is handled through Firebase. In Firebase, I created an admin account for myself to handle uploading and deleting photos. Authenticated users can like photos, and photos are ordered by most liked photo.
